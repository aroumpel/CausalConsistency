Code in R Creates Graphs, samples data and runs the FCI algorithm. Also, creates marginal data sets and runs FCI on them.

Files "fci.R" and "udag2pag.R" in folder codeFCI are copies from the pcalg R package, but we added the "aggressively prevent cycles" option. Thus, if one wants to have the option, they need to source these files after loading the package.
